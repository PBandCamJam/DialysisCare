# Death and Dialysis

A linear regression project exploring the relationship between **transfusion rates** and **mortality rates** in dialysis facilities across the U.S.

Each day, there are thousands of people that sit for hours on end. They get their blood cleaned by machines in an exhausting routine that keeps them alive.
For dialysis providers, the most important metric for a facility is their patient's mortality rate. Keeping these rates low is the driving force of any facility.

It's a pretty simple concept, and it begs the question:
> **Does the frequency of blood transfusions at a faclility hint at how many of its patients ultimately survive?**

More transfusions often signal sicker patients or urgent complications.
By examining transfusions rates alongside readmission rates and hospitalization rates I set out to see whether these routinely reported metrics can predict mortality differences from one clinic to the next.
